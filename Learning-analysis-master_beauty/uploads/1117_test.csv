Story Writing,70,"It’s when I practice creative writing, whether it’s stories, scripts, or just piecing together my ideas into a storyline."
Coding,77,I learned programming so I can know how it works as well as be a solo game designer.
Character Design,95,"I like character creation. It’s partially connected to Creative Writing, and partially Digital and Traditional Art. It is creating the appearance or characters, as well as their profiles and identities. However, it happened that all the stories I put didn’t use the characters put here"
Digital Art,80,"Digital art is drawing on a tablet that’s virtually connected to the screen. It’s like drawing traditional, but you have easier and more range of colors, and your drawing surface is dissociated from where it appears. While knowing how to draw digitally is easier and useful, I often draw in traditional because it feels more natural to me."
English,95,"It’s my first language, but I included it here because I had taken a few English related tests, and I needed to study for them."
Traditional Art,79,"Traditional art is what is sounds like; the usual drawing on paper, although it’s not limited to just pencil sketches and paintings."
